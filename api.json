      "full": "The **langsuir** (also spelled *langsuyar* or *lang suir*) is one of the most feared and culturally significant supernatural entities in Malay folklore. This vampiric demon is created when a woman dies during childbirth or within the forty-day postpartum period, particularly if she dies from shock upon learning of her child's stillbirth or death. The langsuir manifests as a beautiful woman with flowing black hair that reaches to her ankles or trails upon the ground. She possesses long, sharp fingernails and most distinctively, a supernatural hole (*lubang*) in the back of her neck through which she feeds on blood. Unlike Western vampires who bite with fangs, the langsuir uses this neck opening to drain her victims. The creature primarily preys on pregnant women, newborns, and young children, though she may attack anyone who encounters her at night. She is attracted to the scent of blood and amniotic fluid and often haunts banana trees, cemeteries, and places where women have died in childbirth. According to tradition, a langsuir can be captured and temporarily returned to human form by cutting her hair short and stuffing the cut hair along with her trimmed nails into the hole in her neck. However, if these items are removed, she will transform back into her demonic state."
