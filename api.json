      "summary": "A female vampire demon in Malay folklore, created when a woman dies during childbirth. The langsuir is described as beautiful with long hair, possessing a hole in the back of her neck through which she sucks blood, particularly targeting children and newborns.",
      "full": "The langsuir is one of the most feared supernatural entities in Malaysian and broader Malay culture. According to tradition, a woman who dies during childbirth or within forty days of giving birth can become a langsuir, especially if she dies from shock upon learning of her child's stillbirth or death. The transformation creates a beautiful yet terrifying nocturnal creature with long flowing hair that reaches her ankles, sharp fingernails, and most distinctively, a hole (lubang) in the back of her neck through which she feeds on blood. The langsuir preys primarily on pregnant women, newborns, and young children, though she may attack anyone who encounters her. She can be captured and domesticated by cutting her hair and placing her trimmed nails into the hole in her neck, which transforms her back into a human woman, though the transformation may be temporary if these items are removed."
